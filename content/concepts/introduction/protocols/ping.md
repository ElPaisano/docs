## What is Ping?

ICMP Ping is a network utility that can be used as a simple liveness check
for peers to quickly see if another peer is online and measure RTT.

## Ping in libp2p

The libp2p ping protocol is different from the ping command line utility
([ICMP ping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol)),
as it requires an already established libp2p connection.

A peer opens a stream, sends a request with a payload of 32 random
bytes, and the receiver responds with 32 bytes on the same stream.
Peers can reuse a strean for future pings.

Typically, a ping is sent over a stream after the initial protocol negotiation.

The ping protocol ID is `/ipfs/ping/1.0.0`.
