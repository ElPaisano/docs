## What is mplex?

mplex is a stream multiplexer designed for libp2p.
It is a simple protocol that does not provide many features offered by other
stream multiplexers. Notably, mplex does not provide backpressure at the protocol
level.

mplex runs over a reliable, ordered pipe between two peers, such as a TCP connection
or a Unix pipe. Peers can open, write to, close, and reset a stream by sending messages
with the appropriate [flag value](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/mplex#flag-values).
It uses a message-based framing layer like [yamux](yamux), enabling it to multiplex different
types of data streams, including stream-oriented data and other types of messages.

Every message in mplex consists of a header and a length of prefixed data segment.

### Drawbacks

mplex does not support backpressure or have any flow control.
> Backpressure is a mechanism to prevent one peer to overwhelm a peer that's slow at consuming the data.

mplex has no limits on how many streams a peer can open. This allows mplex to support a wide
range of applications and use cases, but it also means that mplex may not be as efficient as other
multiplexing protocols that limit the number of streams that can be opened.

**Yamux should be used over mplex in libp2p**. It is well-suited for applications that
require fast, reliable data transfer as it is optimized for low-latency, high-bandwidth environments.

Until recently, the reason mplex was still supported was compatibility with js-libp2p,
which didn't have yamux support.
Now that
[js-libp2p has gained yamux support](https://github.com/ChainSafe/js-libp2p-yamux/releases/tag/v1.0.0),
mplex should only be used to provide backwards-compatibility with legacy nodes.
